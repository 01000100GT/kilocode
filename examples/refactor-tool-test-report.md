# Refactor Code Tool Test Report

## Summary of Test Results

A comprehensive test plan was executed to evaluate the functionality of the `refactor_code` tool. The test plan included test cases for rename, move, and remove operations, as well as batch operations and edge cases.

- **Test Case 1 (Rename Operation):** Passed. The function was successfully renamed, and all references were updated.
- **Test Case 2 (Move Operation):** Passed. The function was successfully moved to the target file, and imports were updated correctly.
- **Test Case 3 (Remove Operation):** Failed. The function was not removed, despite the tool reporting a successful operation (with verification failure).
- **Test Case 4 (Batch Operation):** Partially Passed. The rename operation within the batch was successful. The move operation successfully moved the function but failed to add all necessary imports to the destination file.
- **Test Case 5.1 (Non-Existent File):** Passed. The tool correctly reported an error for a non-existent file.
- **Test Case 5.2 (Non-Existent Symbol):** Passed. The tool correctly reported an error for a non-existent symbol.
- **Test Case 5.3 (Invalid Operation):** Passed. The tool correctly reported an error for an invalid operation type.

## List of Identified Issues

Based on the test execution, the following issues were identified:

1.  **Remove Operation Failure:** The `remove` operation failed to remove the specified function from the file. The tool reported a verification failure after claiming success.
2.  **Incomplete Imports on Batch Move:** When performing a `move` operation as part of a batch, the tool failed to include all necessary imports in the destination file, leading to incomplete and potentially non-compiling code.

## Overall Assessment of the Tool's Reliability

The `refactor_code` tool demonstrates basic functionality for rename and move operations when executed individually. It also correctly handles edge cases related to non-existent files, symbols, and invalid operations. However, the tool exhibits critical failures in the `remove` operation and in handling imports during batch `move` operations. These issues significantly impact the tool's reliability for more complex refactoring tasks.

## Recommendations for Improvements

1.  **Fix Remove Operation:** Investigate and fix the issue preventing the `remove` operation from correctly deleting code elements. Ensure the tool's internal verification accurately reflects the file state.
2.  **Improve Batch Move Import Handling:** Enhance the `move` operation, especially within batches, to reliably identify and include all necessary imports in the target file. This may require more robust dependency analysis.
3.  **Detailed Error Reporting:** While edge case error reporting was good, the "Operation reported success but verification failed" message for the remove operation could be more specific about *why* verification failed.

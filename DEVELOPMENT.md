1. **Clone** the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode.git
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm run install:all
    ```
4. **Install vscode extensions**:
    Lower right corner of your vs code should show an offer to install extensions; the esbuild problem matcher in particular is required.
5. **Debug**:
    - Press `F5` (or **Run** â†’ **Start Debugging**) in VSCode to open a new session with Kilo Code loaded.

Changes to the webview will appear immediately. Changes to the core extension will require a restart of the extension host.

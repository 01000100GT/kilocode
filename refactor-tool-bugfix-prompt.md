# Refactor Code Tool Bug Fix Request

## Background

I've recently completed testing of our new refactor code tool for TypeScript projects. This tool uses AST-based analysis to perform safe refactoring operations including:

1. **Rename** - Rename symbols while properly updating all references
2. **Move** - Relocate code between files with automatic import/export management
3. **Remove** - Safely remove code elements with reference handling
4. **Batch operations** - Execute multiple refactorings as a single transaction

The tool is implemented in:

- `src/core/tools/refactorCodeTool.ts` - Main implementation
- `src/core/prompts/tools/refactor-code.ts` - Prompt definition
- `src/core/tools/refactor-code/` - Supporting modules (engine, parser, schema, etc.)

## Testing Completed

I've run the test plan from `refactor-tool-test-plan.md` which covered:

- Setting up a test TypeScript project with cross-referenced files
- Testing each operation type individually (rename, move, remove)
- Testing batch operations with multiple changes

The test plan included sample TypeScript files specifically structured to test various refactoring scenarios, and bug reports were filed using the template in `bugreport-template.md`.

## Issues Found

Below is a summary of the issues discovered during testing. Each issue has a corresponding bug report with full details.

[Insert summary of bugs found during testing here. For each issue, include:

1. Bug ID/reference
2. Operation type affected
3. Brief description of the problem
4. Severity assessment
5. Link to the full bug report]

## Files and Code Context

Here are the key implementation files that will need to be modified to fix these issues:

### 1. Schema and Validation

The Zod schema definitions in `src/core/tools/refactor-code/schema.ts` define the structure and validation rules for refactoring operations.

### 2. Parser Implementation

The `RobustLLMRefactorParser` in `src/core/tools/refactor-code/parser.ts` is responsible for parsing and validating the JSON operations from LLM responses.

### 3. Refactor Engine

The `RefactorEngine` in `src/core/tools/refactor-code/engine.ts` executes the actual refactoring operations using the TypeScript compiler API.

### 4. Main Tool Implementation

The `refactorCodeTool` function in `src/core/tools/refactorCodeTool.ts` is the entry point that coordinates the parsing and execution process.

## Fix Requirements

Please analyze the reported issues and implement fixes that:

1. Address the root cause of each bug, not just the symptoms
2. Maintain or improve code quality and test coverage
3. Preserve the existing API and user experience where possible
4. Add appropriate error handling for edge cases
5. Include additional validation where needed

For each fix, please:

- Explain your reasoning and approach
- Update or add unit tests to verify the fix
- Consider performance implications
- Update documentation if the behavior changes

## Technical Context

Our refactoring tool uses:

- **ts-morph** for TypeScript AST manipulation
- **Zod** for schema validation
- A transaction-based approach where all operations in a batch succeed or fail together

The current implementation follows a pipeline:

1. Parse the JSON operations from the LLM response
2. Validate operations against the schema
3. Create snapshots of files before modification
4. Execute operations in sequence
5. Either commit or roll back the transaction based on success

## Edge Cases to Consider

When fixing these issues, please pay special attention to:

1. **Symbol resolution** - Handling overloaded functions, method overrides, and nested symbols
2. **Import management** - Circular dependencies, relative path resolution, and import style consistency
3. **Batch operation atomicity** - Ensuring proper rollback if any operation fails
4. **File system interactions** - Race conditions, file locking, and error handling
5. **Parser robustness** - Handling various LLM response formats and malformed JSON

## Success Criteria

Your fixes will be considered successful if:

1. All reported issues are resolved
2. No regressions are introduced
3. The tool passes the original test plan
4. Code quality is maintained or improved
5. Edge cases are properly handled

Thank you for your help improving our TypeScript refactoring tool!
